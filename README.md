# Chatbot_project
Today, I am going to create my own chatbot. These days, chatbots are used more often than browsers. I wish to develop a chatbot similar to an assistant for individuals. I developed it using the Gemini API, and I will add more features to the chatbot, such as login, session storage, and recent work tracking. We will be able to chat through voice.
