# Chatbot_project
Today, I am going to create my own chatbot. These days, chatbots are used more often than browsers. I wish to develop a chatbot similar to an assistant for individuals. I developed it using the Gemini API, and I will add more features to the chatbot, such as login, session storage, and recent work tracking. We will be able to chat through voice.
 ✔️ 1. just developed a basic chatbot. using :
        1.1 google api key
        1.2 just a simple interface using html, css and javascript.
